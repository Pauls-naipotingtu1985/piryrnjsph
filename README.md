Just walked out of watching Novocaine. My head's still spinning—not sure if from the movie or the sugar rush from the jumbo soda. The theater was like a popcorn battlefield, with crumbs clinging to my clothes like little white barnacles on a ship's hull. 

Steve Martin's face—there was that perpetual blankness, you know, the kind you feel on a Monday morning before coffee. Dentistry and disaster, all wrapped up in a dark, drizzling humor that felt like a damp sock left out in the cold too long. But Laura Dern – her character’s craziness sort of winds around you like a cat rubbing against your leg demanding attention.

>The irony just smacked me right in the face like a pie in one of those old slapstick comedies. Or was it slapstick fumbles? It was loud in there, someone behind me kept unwrapping candies like they were performing surgery. A bit ironic while watching a movie a out a dentist doing some kind of surgery on his own life, right? It was all a colorful mess, spirals spinning faster than a blender making a smoothie.

That one scene, with the drill—a proxy for life’s own relentless grinding—shiver. And what was with his brother's weird side quest? Felt like downloading side content in a video game, almost forgot I was promised a story centered on dentistry, not crime mishaps. 

Watch the movie if you want to feel like you’re dreaming but also falling down stairs—a comedy of errors but where your toothbrush should go. It all went by in such a surreal blur, like watching your days repeat but with dialogue by Tarantino.

Uncanny how these things start to resemble your own chaotic thought patterns, like accidentally typing your password into the search bar. Did someone say I should download the movie? Because that's what it feels like—streaming bits of chaos to slot right into your gray matter. 

Couldn’t shake the feeling of Dr. Frank’s fumbling madness sticking to my consciousness, much like the gum under the theater seat sticks to a pair of unwary shoes. Oy, my back aches – sat too long or maybe tense shoulders during all those pinpricky plot jaunts.

```cpp
// Why is this here even?
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
    cout << Hello, World! << endl; 
    return 0;
}
```
